# Neural Network Charity Analysis: Alphabet Soup

## Purpose: 
To build a machine learning model that will analyze metadata on 34,000+ organizations that use Alphabet Soup. The data is being used to help the foundation determine where to make investments. The model will use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

#### Goals:
<ol>
<li> Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model </li>
<li> Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model </li>
<li> Optimize the Model </li>
</ol>

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
<li> What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? </li>

<li> What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? </li>

<li> What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? </li>

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
<li>How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? </li>

<li>Were you able to achieve the target model performance? </li>

<li>What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? </li>

</ul>
